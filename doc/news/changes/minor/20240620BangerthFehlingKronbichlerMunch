Fixed: AffineConstraints::make_consistent_in_parallel() now iteratively
updates the constraints on user-specified DoFs until the set of constraints
globally converged on all subdomains.
<br>
The function now also updates the locally stored constraints of the
underlying AffineConstraints object. After using this function, it might be
necessary to use the IndexSet retrieved by
AffineConstraints::get_local_lines() when initializing data structures,
for example:
<code>
DynamicSparsityPattern dsp(constraints.get_local_lines());
LinearAlgebra::distributed::Vector<double> solution(
  locally_owned_dofs, constraints.get_local_lines(), mpi_communicator);
</code>
This used to be an issue in parallel hp-adaptive applications, when
finite elements of different types have constraints on faces between
locally relevant and artificial cells.
