Deprecated: Namespace FETools::Compositing had three functions
FETools::Compositing::multiply_dof_numbers(),
FETools::Compositing::compute_restriction_is_additive(), and
FETools::Compositing::compute_nonzero_components() that took pointers to five
finite elements and five multiplicities. These have now been
deprecated in favor of the versions of these functions that take a
vector of elements and a vector of multiplicities.
