Improved: The class PreconditionRelaxation has been refactored.
Just like in the case of PreconditionChebyshev, it can be now used
stand-alone and users can attach their own preconditioners.
Furthermore, users can specify the number of smoothing steps, 
which is particularly useful if PreconditionRelaxation is 
used as smoother in a multigrid algorithm.
