New: The new class MatrixFreeTools::ElementActivationAndDeactivationMatrixFree
is a wrapper around MatrixFree, which helps users to deal with 
DoFHandlers, where there are cells without degrees of freedom, 
i.e., with FENothing assigned to them. The class helps to implement 
"element birth and death technique".
