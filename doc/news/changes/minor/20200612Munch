New: Each cell is assigned a globally unique ID and (if requested) a level ID.
These IDs are integers and originate from a contiguous index set. 
Users can query locally-owned and ghost cells for their IDs via CellAccessor::global_cell_id().
The value is managed automatically by the Triangulation classes.
Furthermore, triangulations deriving from parallel::TriangulationBase provide partitioners
for these IDs. These partitioners can be used to set up ghosted vectors with one entry per
cell.
