     * This calls contains information belonging to the faces of a
     * triangulation. These classes are similar to the TriaLevel classes. As
     * cells are organised in a hierarchical structure of levels, each
     * triangulation consists of several such TriaLevels. However the faces of
     * a triangulation, lower dimensional objects like lines in 2D or lines
     * and quads in 3D, do not have to be based on such a hierarchical
     * structure. In fact we have to organise them in only one object if we
     * want to enable anisotropic refinement. Therefore the TriaFaces classes
     * store the information belonging to the faces of a triangulation
     * separately from the TriaLevel classes.
